# ClickyMouseGame

In this game, a list of three good target objects and one bad target object will spawn in a random position at the bottom of the screen, thrusting themselves into the air with random force and torque. These targets will be destroyed when the player clicks on them.

- Booleans to control game states

- Divide/Assign (/=) operator
- Grouping child objects
